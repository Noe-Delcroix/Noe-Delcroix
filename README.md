# Hello, my name is **No√©**, nice to meet you !

I'm a 20 years old french developer, currently following a work-study program as a web developer in a french children's clothing company called Vertbaudet. I'm studying computer science and network engineering at IMT Nord Europe.
I've been passionate about computers and development for a long time and I'm always looking for new challenges to discover new technologies !

This is my personal GitHub. Here you can find the various projects I've been working on in my spare time.
